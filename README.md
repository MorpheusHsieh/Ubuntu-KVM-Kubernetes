# Ubuntu-KVM-Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Recently, I tried to build my kubernetes and write some script files.

The goal is to simplify the building process.

This project is still undergoing, I will continue to add or modify the content of the project.

The network of this project is composed of five nodes, which are two master, 1 haproxy and two nodes. 

The detail configuration list in k8s-config.json file.

The execution of scripts needs jq package, which is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
