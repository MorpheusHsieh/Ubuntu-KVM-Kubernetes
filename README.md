# Ubuntu-KVM-Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.

I study to build kubernetes 1.6.x by typing commands one by one, and I wish to build kubernetes by automatic script files.

The goal is to simplify the building process.

Therefore, I start this project and will continue this project when I am free.

Recently, I tried to build kubernetes through and write some script files.

The detail configuration listed in k8s-config.json file.

The execution of scripts needs 'jq' package, which is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
